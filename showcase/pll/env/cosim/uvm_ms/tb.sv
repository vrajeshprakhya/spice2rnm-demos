`timescale 1ps/1ps
//======================================================================
// The PLL as a real design is partitioned: ANALOG IN NGSPICE, DIGITAL IN
// RTL, coupled in lockstep.
//
// The VCO, the charge pump and the loop filter are transistor-level SPICE.
// The phase-frequency detector and the divider are the same SystemVerilog
// modules a design would already have. Nothing here is a generated model --
// that is the point. This is the GOLDEN the generated models get checked
// against, and until now there was no way to produce one for an
// analog-only netlist without re-expressing the digital in XSPICE.
//
// TIME. A bare delay is ONE TIMESCALE UNIT, so the `timescale` above is
// what sets the coupling granularity, and the analog is granted exactly as
// far as $realtime has reached. Every delay here is a bare number in
// timescale units, which avoids a simulator bug in unit-suffixed literals:
// on xezim 0.10.5 a time literal in a CONSTANT is scaled to a fixed 1 ns
// rather than to the declaring module's unit, against IEEE 1800-2017 5.8,
// so `localparam realtime T = 100ns` gives a 100 ps delay here and a 100 fs
// one under 1fs/1fs. Run-time forms like `#100ns` are correct. A tick
// constant takes the broken path. See tb_rc.sv for the full table and
// aionhw/xezim#161 for the report.
//
// POLARITY. Taken from what the pipeline MEASURED on this same netlist,
// not from the port names:
//
//   Kvco is NEGATIVE (-3.297e8 Hz/V), so speeding the VCO up needs the
//   control voltage to FALL, so UP must select the SINKING control. The
//   off state was measured at pdn=0/pupb=1, which makes pdn active HIGH
//   and pupb active LOW.
//
//     UP  -> pdn,  asserted HIGH
//     DOWN-> pupb, asserted LOW   (hence the inversion below)
//
// Wiring it the textbook way inverts the loop, and every per-block check
// still passes when it is inverted -- that is how this project's charge
// pump shipped upside down once already.
